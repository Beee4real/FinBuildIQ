# 🧠 Amazon Q Developer Usage Log — FinBuildIQ

## Overview
This document records **how Amazon Q Developer** was used throughout the creation of **FinBuildIQ**, an AI-powered financial intelligence platform that analyzes debts, spending, and credit behavior.

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: Ideation & Planning
**Amazon Q Developer in VS Code** was used to:
- Generate the **initial folder structure** for FinBuildIQ.
- Suggest **AI workflow design** for financial analysis and debt tracking.
- Draft an **architecture outline** that includes:
  - FastAPI backend
  - AI analysis engine
  - Integration points for BVN/credit APIs.

🧩 Example Prompt Used:
> “Generate a Python project structure for an AI-driven debt and credit tracking app named FinBuildIQ using FastAPI.”

---

## 💻 Phase 2: Development
Amazon Q helped write and refactor multiple parts of the codebase:

**Key Areas:**
- Generated base code for `main.py` (FastAPI entry point).  
- Suggested logic for debt score calculation in `debt_analyzer.py`.  
- Provided test prompts and API validation for `/analyze` endpoint.  
- Automated docstring generation and improved variable naming.

🧩 Example Prompt:
> “Create a FastAPI route that receives financial data, calculates debt ratio, and returns credit risk level as JSON.”

## 🧪 Phase 3: Debugging & Testing
- Used Q Developer to identify and fix missing imports and syntax errors.  
- Q suggested sample JSON payloads to test endpoints.  
- Helped troubleshoot local `uvicorn` server errors.

🧩 Example Prompt:
> “Why does my FastAPI endpoint return 422 Unprocessable Entity error? Fix it.”

---

## 📚 Phase 4: Documentation
- Used Q to draft README.md structure (overview, features, setup, usage).  
- Assisted in writing Hackathon submission guide (GitHub + presentation).  
- Generated MIT License boilerplate.

🧩 Example Prompt:
> “Write a hackathon-friendly README.md for an AI finance app using Amazon Q Developer.”

---

## 📈 Phase 5: Refinement & AI Enhancement
- Brainstormed with Q for BVN/SSN integration ideas (for global users).  
- Refined roadmap with suggestions for adding Web3 tokenization and rewards system.  
- Optimized function flow for scalability and modular design.

---

## ✅ Summary
Amazon Q Developer was used extensively throughout all project stages to:
- Plan architecture  
- Generate and refactor code  
- Debug endpoints  
- Create documentation
